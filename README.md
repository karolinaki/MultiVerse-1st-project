# MultiVerse-1st-project
personal page, first project W4


How was this website made??

By scouring the net and dusting over old knowledge and desperately trying to retain the newly acquired skills from Multiverse.

Problems on the way!
* All the fancy CSS I wanted to use is in SASS formatting which I have no knowledge on! BOO!
* Why am I so BORING? Is this what I put out into the world? Who am I? (identity crisis No#1)
* Genius! Maybe create a repo on GitHub before you hit commit, LOL
* Being minimalist is one thing.... Creating the turkish prison cell equivalent of a website is another!
